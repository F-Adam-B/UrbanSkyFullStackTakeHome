# Running the Application

This application is split into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. Below are the instructions on how to run both parts of the application.

## Frontend Instructions

To get the frontend up and running, follow these steps:

1. Change directory into the frontend application folder:
   ```bash
   cd us-inventory-react-app
   ```
2. Install the necessary npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

The frontend should now be accessible through your web browser at the default address (usually it's `http://localhost:3000`).

## Backend Instructions

For the backend part of the application, you will need to:

1. `cd` into the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the backend server in development mode by executing:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend server will start and typically listen on `http://localhost:5000` or another port specified in the backend configuration.
